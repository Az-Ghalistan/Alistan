# On becoming a happy individual
The following text is an official statement from Ghâli ibn Hakim, the Paramount leader of Az-Ghâlistan. 

Assalam u alaykoum wa rahmatoullahu wa barakatuh. Peace and prayers be upon our beloved messenger, who engaged his life to fulfill his divine purpose. And glory to God, he (sbh) who gave a clear path to the whole of humanity, He (sbh) who brought us all from *Ad-dhulumat* (meaning obscurity and nonsense) to *An-nur* (meaning the light, the one of a clear path).

Today, humble Ghâli ibn Hakim decided to share a philosophical soliloquy with his beloved community.

Indeed, our all-mighty and only God gave us a clear set of instructions that, if correctly followed, would lead us to both happiness in the dunya, and happiness in the hereafter.
But still though, thousands of "advanced" civilisations still wonder what's the key for happiness. How to become a happy individual ?

## Where does the necessity of happiness come from ?

In an everyday basis, some people use happiness as an indicator of good doing or wrongdoing : often, they do feel good while doing something that's either directly or indirectly beneficial to them, and they do feel bad while doing something that could destroy one of their goals. But sometimes, a blind pursuit of happiness can lead people to want for themselves what's harmful, and erroneously reject what's beneficial. Greek philosopher Epicurus approached a similar idea in Letter to Menoeceus.

Allah says in Al-Baqara (2:216)
> Fighting has been made obligatory upon you believers, though you dislike it. Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know.

As precisely mentioned in the verse, "Allah knows and you do not know" : it is the creator's duty to teach what's ultimately good and what's ultimately bad to his creatures. From that we deduce that our sight, our ears and our brain are all failing at ultimately deciding for us : we absolutely need an external assistance in order to attain *al-furqan* (the perfect judgment between good and evil).

Allah says in Al-Baqara (2:256)

> [...] So whoever renounces false gods and believes in Allah has certainly grasped the firmest, unfailing hand-hold. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

For example, one could ask "how is *az-zina* wrong ?" or "where is the wrong in consuming drugs, doing *ar-riba*, or even wearing silk ?".
At first glance, these actions do not appear to harm anyone. And demonstrating "why they do" is a challenge between faith and temptation. What happens when someone is deprived of faith ? We is not willing to demonstrate why such actions could be harmful to him (or society), because his desires took over his life : ultimately, he concludes that such actions are actually not harmful to anyone.

Ma'alim fi al-Tariq, Sayid Qutb (1964)
> [...] the American way of life is based on carnal desires and primitive needs. No matter how much Americans have attained in terms of science and technology, they still behave like animals, with their primitive and barbaric tendencies.

Interestingly, Sayid's critic serves as an explanation of why the morality of western countries has declined. Despite their high intelligence and mastery in domains such as arts, physics, computer engineering or economy, the peoples of the West have been ultimately incapable of beholding their core, divine values. As soon as the West decided to lead its own path to happiness, immorality started tingling its feet.

I understand that when happiness is felt (for exemple while or after performing a halal deed), it shouldn't be repulsed. Happiness in itself is a natural emotion; however, its usage as an indicator for personal or national judgment is sinful, unhealthy, biased and vicious, and leads to continuous deception.

Narrated Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) (Sunan Ibn Majah)
> When the Prophet (ﷺ) heard news that made him happy, or for which one should be happy, he would fall down prostrate in gratitude to Allah, the Blessed and Exalted.

## A personal advice on becoming a happy individual

Such an advice should split into two categories : one for men, one for women.
We are all so different; however what both unites and divides us is our gender. Despite our sensation of control, it serves as our main basis to set our personal goals. Also, it stands as a way for us to know how to take our social decisions.

We have proven ourselves that happiness is a natural, "independent" emotion. Now, in order to find a way to provoke it in the long term, we should first get to know when and why we find ourselves happy.

## Happiness for men

In order to describe men, simply have a glimpse at most women's ideal relationship: men are thought of as individuals of exploding capacity.
They find themselves happy when they know their incredible capacity has been made useful (i.e. when accomplishments are made). These accomplishments are various, but they all, one way or another, ultimately sustain the goal of spreading a long-living ideal, modernly carried through history by a family name. Men ideally want to have an impact on their environment - they secretly want their footprint to bring honor to the men who existed before them, and the men who will exist after them. That explains why men are so eager to explore, conquer, and control.

In Plato's Symposium, a similar idea is introduced by Diotima of Mantinea, a greek philosopher
> There is a certain age at which human nature is desirous of procreation-procreation [...]; for conception and generation are an immortal principle in the mortal creature.

Before trying to reach happiness and satisfaction, men should start fixing an ideal for themselves. Something bigger than themselves, that they are truly eager to achieve.

However, such an ideal can become a cause for deception. For instance, it is generally a bad idea to hold wealth and power as your ultimate goal, because the scale keeps upscaling : you might never find yourself satisfied of what you have, because you have based your life on the pursuit of something which is totally immediate.

Allah says in At-Takathur (102:1-2)

> Competition for more gains diverts you from Allah, until you end up in your graves.

Instead, Allah (glory to Him) offers us the non-exhausting, rational ideal of reaching his mercy in both the dunya and the hereafter.

Allah says in Yunus (10:26)
> Those who do good will have the finest reward and even more. Neither gloom nor disgrace will cover their faces. It is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever.

Such an objective is a perfectly sane and durable way of becoming happy, as it offers the continuous hope of something greater, officially guaranteed by the promise of God, thus letting the brain simmer down at the sight of a future of eternal, retributed success.
Also, exploring the promise of God is a shake-proof ideal, as it never dies as soon as your faith lives, whatever bad may happen in your life : it is unbound to any material, temporal or logical ties.

Allah says in Yunus (10:55)
> Surely to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Surely Allah’s promise is always true, but most of them do not know.

However, some people argue that such a promise make men lazy and unproductive. Indeed, it makes men lazy and unproductive in sin and futile enjoyments of the daily life, and encourages them to work hard for their retribution instead, making good deeds and helping society, overall becoming grateful individuals whose place is well deserved.

Narrated Ka'ab bin Ujrah (may Allah be pleased with him) (Jami' at-Tirmidhi)
Muhammad ﷺ said:
>  [...] Sawm (fasting) is an impregnable shield, and Sadaqah (charity) extinguishes sins just as water extinguishes fire.

## Happiness for women

Women are individuals of incredible vulnerability. They are bound to the assistance and judgement of others : there is no such thing as an independent woman.
Women are naturally weak and live to seek protection. They are eager to lead a protected life, brought up by a man of exploding capacity.
Women are fundamentally excited by the very idea of beneficing (living under the protection) of something that's more capable than them: that is their natural, default ideal.

Of course some women try to escape the system, thriving to totally assume themselves, but these usually do not live at the fullest, as they unnaturally bend to fit into the deviant, happiness-oriented social suggestions offered by men whose desire is to trick them.
Many of these men are capitalists, high-ranked individuals, of course : to better control a people, enslave it first by destabilizing its women, thus destroying families, thus destabilizing its youth... thus making it easier to change the society's core values, again bending it to fit into the most lucrative economical models.

Wise women should be aware of their weakness. Here is the very starting point for them to lead a continuously happy life. 

Let's find a way to make women happy. We know they intrinsically love to live under the protection of a bigger force.
In the western world, this bigger force is dug from attention from social media, men, and money. Western women seek refuge in the place they hold in the society they live in, pushed by their beauty. In other words, western women get their daily life happiness from the desire of men who live around them: a widespread phenomenon in the United States, where they even gave it a name, they call it "simping".
This is a problem for three main reasons. First, it starts an unfair rivalry between women, where some are pushed to the top of the scene and others, less beautiful, are left back. Also, it naturally creates a system where the most loved women are the most beautiful ones, neglecting their reason and integrity as individuals, converting them into mere objects rivalizing one another.
This leads us to the third problem, which is the condition of these very women when they get older, as their beauty slowly disappears. Now, they haven't got any children and haven't got into any unique relation, as they could simply live under the sexual urges of men around them. Now their power is thrown out and they are condemned to live sad and lonely.

By criminalizing *az-zina* in our society and forcing women to hide their traits, we are preventing women from converting themselves into mere objects. Whether it is men or women's fault, whether you can make them believe they can change their nature or not: at the end of the day, men are men deep in themselves, and if such a system publicly exists, however men are educated, they will eventually feed it.
Criminalizing indecency is the only way of saving our society from poisoning itself. Also, we have written a declaration on public decency.

Allah says in Al-Azhab (32)
> O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women: if you are mindful of Allah, then do not be overly effeminate in speech with men or those with sickness in their hearts may be tempted, but speak in a moderate tone.

Now we know that women ultimately want to live their life under the protection of a bigger force, but we do not want this force to be centered around men, because we have studied the danger it represents for women.

Thus, we conclude that the best way for a woman to be happy is to fulfill her desire for protection by marrying a strong, respected husband she will obey and stand by, as offered by Allah (glory to Him).

Allah says in An-Nisa (34)
> Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women and tasked with supporting them financially. And righteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what Allah has entrusted them with [...]

Another wise advise for women is to seek refuge in Allah (glory to Him). Indeed, God protects women better than men do. Indeed, our safety as humans is guaranteed by Allah.
Naturally, it is true to say God clearly and entirely fulfills the needs for "the protection of a better force" women have. There is no "better force" than the one of Allah (glory to Him), and women are deeply happy living under such a sacred safety, as their thrive for the perfect safety and stability is continuously answered.

Allah says in At-Tawba (51)
> Say, “Nothing will ever befall us except what Allah has destined for us. He is our Protector.” So in Allah let the believers put their trust.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, we can say that, in order to attain happiness and satisfaction in their lives, both men and women should become aware of natural goals that emerge from their respective gender; goals which were deduced in the observation of human behavior through history.
